# Project: Identify Customer Segments

In this project,  unsupervised learning techniques are applied to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

There are four files associated with this project (not including this one):

- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.
- `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns

Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood.
